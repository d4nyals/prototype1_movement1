# prototype1_movement1
The first prototype for my Computer Science Coursework, focusing on the movement of the player, which should attempt to move left, right up and down, as well as not going beyond the given resolution screen.

Prototype 1 will also focus on certain attributes involving the main menu screen, as this is also a simple GUI interface to code in Pygame. This shouldn't take up too much time
